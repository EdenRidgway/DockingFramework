DockingFramework
================

C# Docking Framework based on Mono develop docking to add easily new components/widgets.

Unfortunately an explicit docking framework seems to be not exist for C#/GTK,
but a good starting project exist with the mono develop framework itself. 

Hopefully in the near future, depending on the time I can spend for this project, this Docking Framework
filled with more useful examples to test and expand functionality.

More details I will add next...
